<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avatar The Way of Water</h3>
<p>
  This movie is a 2022 American epic science fiction film co-produced and
  directed by James Cameron and it is the highest-grossing film of the all time.
  The viewers could enjoy this as a 3D film so did I.The spectecular digital and
  3D technology used by the production in this film has made it on to another
  level and suits for every one in the family.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  One of my favourite Japanese anime movie which takes you into the world of
  spirits. This movie shows a child's utmost courage and wisdom in resuing her
  parents who have become pigs and bring them back into human form. This
  beautiful movie shows her journey of freeing her parents from spirits curse by
  making freinds with spirits and accomplishing challenges on her way.

<h3>A man called Otto</h3>
<p>
  This movie is a 2022 American comedy-drama film directed by Marc Forster about
  a bitter old man reluctantly getting involved in the lives of his neighbors.
  It stars Tom Hanks in the title role and it is a remake of the 2015 Swedish
  film A Man Called Ove, which was based on the 2012 novel by Fredrik Backman.
  This heart touching movie shows a little act of humanity and love is all that
  you need to enliven someone.
